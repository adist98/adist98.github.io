## Reference Notes
1. A constructor is a special member function that has the **same name as class**. It's purpose is to ensure that each data member is set to sensible initial values.
`Source (Pg.431 -C++ Primer)`
2. Writing `std::cout` uses the **scope operator**(::) to say we want to use the name `cout` that is in the `namespace std`.
`Source (Pg.8 -C++ Primer)`
3. Each class defines an **interface** and **implementation**. The interface consists of the operations that we expect code that uses the class to execute. The implementationtypically consists the data needed by the class. The implementation also includes any functions needed to define the class but that are not intended for the general use.
`Source (Pg.63 -C++ Primer)`
4. A defintion must always end in semicolon, that is why a class definition also ends in semicolon.
5. `Pg.49 -C++ Primer`
